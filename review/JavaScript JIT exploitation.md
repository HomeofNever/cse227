Grading comment:
In order for JavaScript to run efficiently, it make use of a technology called JIT, which compiled frequently used code to lower level, instead of feeding into interpreter each time, so that they could run faster. However, there are also various optimizations happen during the process, and JavaScript is a dynamic typed language. JIT may generate codes that does not have the same effect as the interpreter. Even worse, cause type confusion due to missing checks and unexpected side effects. Effectively identify these issue become a problem.

Grading comment:
The paper proposed a semantics-aware code generation for finding vulnerabilities in JavaScript Engines. Before that, most of the fuzzers can only generate synthetically correct code but failed in semantics shortly, which is hardly useful and comes with many limitation. CodeAlchemist takes a set of unique snippets, parsing them in form of AST, turn them into various code bricks (JavaScript statements), normalize variables, generate code that fits in the semantics constraints (type analysis that fit into each other). To eliminate syntax error, code will first feed into engine and check if it has syntax error. If so, code will be discarded. Some functions like crash is not tested to avoid false alarms.
Q3 Would you have solved the problem differently? If so, how?

Grading comment:
I believe this is pretty clever to fit into type so that much less work need to be done but being more effective in various perspective. As the paper mention, the closer your code get to the spcs, the more work you are about to put on, which is pretty much writing an engine at the end. The paper doesn't mentioned much about they acquire the code pool, but maybe we could have some automatically way to build the code base, either from various public code or build from specifications automatically.
Q4 What is the most interesting part of the paper?
5 Points
Grading comment:
The code fuzzers generated before this paper on average cannot run/not valid for more than 3 statements for each of them, and it could find more than 2,800 bugs, which means that maybe the engine itself could use lots of improvement
