Q1 What problem is this work addressing?

The paper is about automatically find exploitable vulnerabilities and also generate attack string based on the information gathered from analysis of source code and binary itself within feasible amount of time. The traditional ways may take too much time to explore and static source code analysis sometimes has false positive (unsafe but not exploitable)

Q2 How did the author(s) address the problem?

Author introduce an end-to-end solution, AEG, which includes an algorithm that take source code and compiled bytecode, generate pre-condition, exhausted loop and various other technique to limits the search range, and prioritize unsafe branch to improve overall efficiency. This tool also mimic environment to verify and make sure that the exploits can be reliably reproduce before report to user.

Q3 Would you have solved the problem differently? If so, how?

I think that author has provided a good foundation for future works. The overall algorithm sounds pretty reasonable. For the verification part, instead of mimic the environment, we may spin up virtual machines with pre-built system & target binary and test in place. (e.g. QEMU memory API). Although it may require more adoption of reproduce exploits from the inform given, but the results can be more reliable.

Q4 What is the most interesting part of the paper?

The most interesting part to me would be the environment mimic. I didn't realize that environment, or even the path changes will cause changes to program stack as it will be copy over. It does make verification in place harder.
