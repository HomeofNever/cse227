Q1 What problem is this work addressing?
5 Points
Grading comment:
Modern CPU has used various technique to speed up execution, such as branch predictions. CPU will tried to execute the both branch beforehand and discarded the wrong one once the branch condition has been determined. During the process, the code is executed may execute at higher level privilege where it may access any variables or memory space it has, but the result will not be passed so the data isolation is kept.
Q2 How did the author(s) address the problem?

Grading comment:
The author proposed a side channel attach over this specific effect, where even though the effect caused by the wrong prediction has been reverted, some of them are not properly done, such as cache line. So, attacker may force CPU to run code that is illegal and leave cache side effect behind, and test in its own namespace using access time to determine in its namespace. This enable attacker to leak any data with limited privilege.
Q3 Would you have solved the problem differently? If so, how?

Grading comment:
This is an amazing idea and pretty much enable lots of possibly attach, and hard to eliminate unless foundational changes over CPU microcode and cause performance degrade.
Q4 What is the most interesting part of the paper?
5 Points
Grading comment:
The way it leaks the data is pretty impressive, without this writeup it is hard to believe it would be a practical attach surface and proved pretty effective.
