# Q1 What problem is this work addressing?

Exploit stack buffered overflow without accessing the targeted binary or source code, a generic, feasible way to detect gadgets and get around ASLR and various protections.

# Q2 How did the author(s) address the problem?

With BROP technique, it is possible to guess the bytes by continuously triggering the exploit until enough information is gathered for write command be called and binary could be sent back for further analysis. Author also provide several optimized approach such as using PLT to get more useful gadget.

# Q3 Would you have solved the problem differently? If so, how?

I don't really have prior experience about binary exploits so this gadget way for code execution sounds pretty clever to me. However, I am thinking if sending the binary would be a good idea as firewall could detect such behavior. Some obfuscation could be used here.

# Q4 What is the most interesting part of the paper?

I believe the utilization of crash restart happened at most of the server high availability set up is pretty interesting. The optimization (PLT) approach is also pretty clever. The observation of randomization and different sys call crash behavior is also amazing.
